# MidwinterMurders

A Ludum Dare compo game attempt!


## Prerequisites

This project is built using [Hazelight's](https://www.hazelight.se/) [Angelscript branch of Unreal Engine 4](https://angelscript.hazelight.se/), specifically the [**4.26.1** release](https://github.com/Hazelight/UnrealEngine-Angelscript/releases/tag/v4.26.1-angelscript).

In order to access the **UnrealEngine-Angelscript** Github repository, you must have your Github account linked to your Epic Games account - [you can follow the guide to set up **UnrealEngine-Angelscript** here](https://angelscript.hazelight.se/installation/).


## Development

You can open the game project using the Unreal Engine 4 project selector that launches from the UnrealEngine-Angelscript release of `UE4Editor.exe`.

I recommend using Visual Studio Code to work with the Angelscript code in the project. Simply open this folder in VSCode and it will prompt you to open the workspace.

Look in the Extensions pane of VSCode to see the Workspace Recommendations and install the **Unreal Angelscript** and **Angelscript Lint** extensions.


### Building the standalone game

Simply run the automation tools from inside the Unreal 4 Editor, using *File -> Package Project -> Windows (64-bit)*.
